Functionality:
Add new todos with an optional due date
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks individually
Form validation for required fields
Popup form with smooth open/close animations
Task states and UI update instantly without reloading the page
Layout adapts for mobile screens

Technology:
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for layout, animations, and responsive design
JavaScript (ES6 modules) for logic and component structure
Class-based components (Todo, FormValidator)
UUID library for generating unique task IDs
Template cloning for rendering todos
GitHub Pages for deployment
